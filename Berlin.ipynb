Most accuracy ist registered 4 places better (7 digits after the dot).

    "\n",
    "In the eastern part there are a lot of places in the well-off parts like Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Friedrichshein. The areas in the north of the city center (Wedding, Pankow, Moabit, etc.) and in the south (Neukölln) have fewer italian places. The places with fewer places are those were more immigrants live, so italian food might be more a thing for the people without and immigrational background. "

    "The data for Berlin is generally on a high level and shows a lot of details. For some values standards are not followed. I would suggest to have an extra key for the maxspeed of the ways (ways_tags) that refers strictly to the speed limit by law. This key should be called 'speedlimit'. Additional information must be provided on the time the speed limit is valid. This change would enable optimized routing based on speed limits not only on the length of the ways. It would also enable owners of car fleets who monitor their fleets to compare their actual speed performance with a legal maximum for the route the vehicle took."
